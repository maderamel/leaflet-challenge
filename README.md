# leaflet-challenge

## Requirements

### Map
TileLayer loads without error

Connects to geojson API using D3 without error 

Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude 

A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color 

### Data Points
Data points scale with magnitude level 

Data points colors change with depth level

Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth

All data points load in the correct locations

## Challenges
The goal of this challenge was to create a functional map that displays earthquake data. The map should indicate the location, lagnitude, and depth of the earthquakes by markers varying in color (depth) and size (magnitude).
